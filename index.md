#Freds Vim Cheat Sheet

##The line number things that I forget all the time
* :set rnu - turn on relative line numbers
* :set nornu - turn off relative line numbers

these next two are good for your .vimrc
* autocmd InsertEnter * :set norelativenumber - when you are entering insert mode remove the line numbers
* autocmd InsertLeave * :set relativenumber - when you  are exiting insert mode (i.e. entering command mode) add line numbers

##Cursor movement (Inside command/normal mode)

* `w` - jump by start of words (punctuation considered words)
* `W` - jump by words (spaces separate words)
* `e` - jump to end of words (punctuation considered words)
* `E` - jump to end of words (no punctuation)
* `b` - jump backward by words (punctuation considered words)
* `B` - jump backward by words (no punctuation)
* `0` - (zero) start of line
* `^` - first non-blank character of line (same as 0w)
* `$` - end of line
* Advanced (in order of what I find useful)
    * `Ctrl+d` - move down half a page
    * `Ctrl+u` - move up half a page
    * `}` - go forward by paragraph (the next blank line)
    * `{` - go backward by paragraph (the next blank line)
    * `gg` - go to the top of the page
    * `G` - go the bottom of the page
    * `: [num] [enter]` - Go To that line in the document
    * Searching
        * `f [char]` - Move to the next char on the current line after the cursor
        * `F [char]` - Move to the next char on the current line before the cursor
        * `t [char]` - Move to before the next char on the current line after the cursor
        * `T [char]` - Move to before the next char on the current line before the cursor
        * All these commands can be followed by `;` (semicolon) to go to the next searched item, and `,` (comma) to go the the previous searched item

##Insert/Appending/Editing Text
* Results in insert mode
    * `i` - start insert mode at cursor
    * `I` - insert at the beginning of the line
    * `a` - append after the cursor
    * `A` - append at the end of the line
    * `o` - open (append) blank line below current line (no need to press return)
    * `O` - open blank line above current line
    * `cc` - change (replace) an entire line
    * `c  [movement command]` - change (replace) from the cursor to the move-to point.
    * ex. `ce` changes from the cursor to the end of the cursor word
* Esc - exit insert mode
* `r  [char]` - replace a single character with the specified char (does not use insert mode)
* `d` - delete
    * `d` - [movement command] deletes from the cursor to the move-to point.
    * ex. `de` deletes from the cursor to the end of the current word
* `dd` - delete the current line
* Advanced
    * `J` - join line below to the current one

##Marking text (visual mode)
* `v` - starts visual mode
    * From here you can move around as in normal mode (hjkl etc.) and can then do a command (such as `y`, `d`, or `c`)
* `V` - starts linewise visual mode
* `Ctrl+v` - start visual block mode
* `Esc` - exit visual mode
* Advanced
    * `O` - move to Other corner of block
    * `o` - move to other end of marked area

##Visual commands
Type any of these while some text is selected to apply the action

* `y` - yank (copy) marked text
* `d` - delete marked text
* `c` - delete the marked text and go into insert mode (like c does above)

##Cut and Paste
* `yy` - yank (copy) a line
* `p` - put (paste) the clipboard after cursor
* `P` - put (paste) before cursor
* `dd` - delete (cut) a line
* `x` - delete (cut) current character
* `X` - delete previous character (like backspace)

##Exiting
* `:w` - write (save) the file, but don't exit
* `:wq` - write (save) and quit
* `:q` - quit (fails if anything has changed)
* `:q!` - quit and throw away changes

##Search/Replace
* `/pattern` - search for pattern
* `?pattern` - search backward for pattern
* `n` - repeat search in same direction
* `N` - repeat search in opposite direction
* `:%s/old/new/g` - replace all old with new throughout file ([gn](https://github.com/vinitkumar/white-paper) is better though)
* `:%s/old/new/gc` - replace all old with new throughout file with confirmations

##Working with multiple files
* `:e filename` - Edit a file
* `:tabe` - make a new tab
* `gt` - go to the next tab
* `gT` - go to the previous tab
* Advanced
    * `:vsp` - vertically split windows
    * `ctrl+ws` - Split windows horizontally
    * `ctrl+wv` - Split windows vertically
    * `ctrl+ww` - switch between windows
    * `ctrl+wq` - Quit a window

##Marks
Marks allow you to jump to designated points in your code.

* `m{a-z}` - Set mark {a-z} at cursor position 
* A capital mark {A-Z} sets a global mark and will work between files
* `‘{a-z}` - move the cursor to the start of the line where the mark was set
* `‘’` - go back to the previous jump location

##General
* `u` - undo
* `Ctrl+r` - redo
* `.` - repeat last command
